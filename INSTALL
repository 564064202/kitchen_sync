To compile Kitchen Sync, you will need:
* a C++11 compiler
* cmake
* boost program options library
* openssl library headers
* postgresql client library headers; and/or
* mysql client library headers

You can install these on Ubuntu using:
  apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost-program-options-dev libssl-dev
And one or both out of:
  apt-get install libpq-dev
  apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

Homebrew users can install these on OS X using:
  brew install cmake boost
And one or both out of:
  brew install postgresql
  brew install mysql

To build, change to the kitchen_sync directory where you checked out the files, then:
  cd build
  cmake .. && make

If you want to run the test suite, you'll also need Ruby and the following gems installed:
  mocha msgpack pg mysql2
To run the suite, change to the kitchen_sync directory where you checked out the files, then:
  cd build
  cmake .. && make test
The normal cmake behavior is to report failures without giving any actual information about
them.  To get cmake to output on failures, use CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE:
  cmake .. && CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 make test
You can also inspect the full test output in Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log.
