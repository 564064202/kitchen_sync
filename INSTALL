To compile Kitchen Sync, you will need:
* cmake
* msgpack C library
* boost program options library
* boost regex library
* openssl library headers
* postgresql client library headers
* mysql client library headers

You can install these on Ubuntu using:
  apt-get install build-essential cmake libmsgpack-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev libssl-dev libpq-dev libmysqlclient-dev

If you want to run the test suite, you'll also need Ruby and the following gems installed: mocha msgpack pg mysql2

To build, change to the kitchen_sync directory where you checked out the files, then:
  cd build
  cmake .. && make
